# MicroPython ESP32 DHT11 Web Server

This project is a complete solution for creating a wireless environmental monitoring system using an **ESP32** microcontroller and a **DHT11 sensor**. It leverages the built-in Wi-Fi capabilities of the ESP32 to serve a dynamic web page that displays real-time temperature and humidity data. The web interface is designed to be user-friendly and automatically refreshes, providing an up-to-the-minute view of your environment.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system operates on a client-server model:

1.  **Wi-Fi Connection**: The ESP32 is programmed to act as a **Wi-Fi station (STA)**, connecting to your local network using a specified SSID and password.
2.  **Web Server**: Once connected, the ESP32 creates a web server on **port 80**. It listens for incoming HTTP requests from any device on the same network.
3.  **Sensor Reading**: When a request is received, the ESP32 reads the temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor.
4.  **Dynamic Web Page**: The microcontroller then generates an **HTML web page** on the fly. It embeds the current sensor readings directly into the HTML code.
5.  **Response & Auto-Refresh**: The ESP32 sends the generated HTML back to the client's web browser. The HTML includes a meta tag that instructs the browser to reload the page every 3 seconds, ensuring the data is always current.
6.  **Error Handling**: The code includes a `try-except` block to manage potential sensor reading failures or network issues, preventing the program from crashing and making it more robust.

#### Circuit Diagram

![Circuit Diagram](Circuit_Diagram/circuit_image.png)


The wiring is straightforward. The DHT11 sensor has three pins: VCC, GND, and a data pin.

| DHT11 Pin | ESP32 Pin | Connection Type |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------------- |
| **VCC** | **3.3V** | Power |
| **GND** | **GND** | Ground |
| **Data** | **GPIO4** | Data Signal |

### üñ•Ô∏è Software Setup

1.  **Install MicroPython Firmware**: Before you can upload the code, you must flash the MicroPython firmware onto your ESP32. Detailed instructions can be found on the [official MicroPython downloads page](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/). We recommend using **Thonny IDE**, which simplifies the process of flashing firmware and uploading code.
2.  **Upload the Code**: Save the provided code as `main.py` and upload it to your ESP32's filesystem using Thonny. The ESP32 automatically executes the `main.py` file on startup.
3.  **Configure Wi-Fi**: Open the `main.py` file and update the `SSID` and `PASSWORD` variables with your local Wi-Fi network credentials.

    ```python
    SSID = "your_network_name"
    PASSWORD = "your_network_password"
    ```

### üöÄ Usage

1.  **Power On**: Connect your ESP32 to a power source using the Micro-USB cable.
2.  **Find the IP Address**: The ESP32 will connect to your Wi-Fi network and print its assigned IP address in the serial console (e.g., Thonny's shell).
3.  **Access the Web Server**: Open a web browser on any device connected to the same network and enter the IP address. The web page will load, displaying the live temperature and humidity data. The `meta refresh` tag will ensure the page updates automatically every 3 seconds.
