# MicroPython ESP32 MQ-4 Gas Sensor to Blynk IoT Dashboard

This project demonstrates how to connect an **MQ-4 Methane Gas Sensor** to an **ESP32** running MicroPython, read its analog values, and send them to a **Blynk IoT dashboard** using the HTTP API. This allows for remote monitoring of gas levels, ideal for safety applications, environmental sensing, or educational purposes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This system integrates hardware and cloud services to provide real-time gas level monitoring:

1.  **MQ-4 Sensor Reading**: The MQ-4 gas sensor, an analog device, detects methane and other combustible gases. Its output voltage changes proportionally to the gas concentration. The ESP32's **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** reads this voltage, converting it into a digital value (0-1023 for 10-bit resolution).
2.  **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: The ESP32 connects to a specified Wi-Fi network, enabling internet access.
3.  **Blynk Cloud Integration**: Using the `urequests` library, the ESP32 makes HTTP GET requests to the Blynk Cloud API. These requests include the unique `BLYNK_TOKEN` and the gas sensor's reading, which is then mapped to a designated **Virtual Pin (V0)** on your Blynk dashboard.
4.  **Remote Monitoring**: The Blynk mobile app or web dashboard displays the gas sensor data in real-time using a Gauge widget, allowing you to monitor gas levels from anywhere with an internet connection.
5.  **Resource Management**: `gc.collect()` is used to manage memory efficiently, especially important for long-running MicroPython applications on resource-constrained devices.

### üß± Components and Connections

To build this project, you will need the following hardware components:

* **ESP32 Development Board** üß†
* **MQ-4 Methane Gas Sensor Module** üßØ (Note: This module often includes a heater and basic signal conditioning)
* **Breadboard** (highly recommended for easy assembly)
* **Jumper Wires**
* **Micro-USB Cable** for power and programming

#### Circuit Diagram

The MQ-4 gas sensor module typically has 4 pins: VCC, GND, DO (Digital Out), and AO (Analog Out). For analog readings, we will use the AO pin.

| MQ-4 Pin | ESP32 Pin      | Connection Type      |
| :------- | :------------- | :------------------- |
| **VCC** | **5V** or **3.3V** | Power (check MQ-4 module voltage spec, typically 5V) |
| **GND** | **GND** | Ground               |
| **AO** | **GPIO34** | Analog Input (ADC1_CH6) |
| **DO** | *(Not used in this project for analog reading)* | Digital Output (for threshold alerts) |

**Important Note**: Many MQ-series sensor modules operate optimally at 5V. Ensure your ESP32 board can provide 5V or use an external 5V power supply. If your MQ-4 module has an onboard voltage regulator and is designed for 3.3V input, you can connect VCC to 3.3V. Always check your specific MQ-4 module's datasheet.

### üñ•Ô∏è Software Setup

1.  **Install MicroPython Firmware**: If your ESP32 isn't already running MicroPython, you'll need to flash the firmware. You can find detailed instructions and the latest firmware on the [official MicroPython downloads page](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/). **Thonny IDE** is an excellent tool for flashing firmware and managing MicroPython files.

2.  **Upload the Code**: Save the provided Python code as `main.py` and upload it to your ESP32's filesystem using Thonny IDE. The `main.py` file is automatically executed when the ESP32 boots.

3.  **Install `urequests` Library**: The `urequests` library is essential for making HTTP requests.
    * In Thonny, go to `Tools > Manage packages...`
    * Search for `micropython-urequests` and install it.
    * Alternatively, you can manually upload the `urequests.py` file to your ESP32's `lib` directory.

4.  **Configure Wi-Fi and Blynk Credentials**: Open the `main.py` file and update the following variables:

    ```python
    SSID = "your_wifi_network_name"       # Your Wi-Fi SSID
    PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"       # Your Wi-Fi Password

    BLYNK_TOKEN = "YOUR_BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN" # Your unique Blynk Auth Token
    MQ4_VPIN = "V0"                       # Virtual Pin for MQ-4 data (e.g., V0)
    ```
    * To get your `BLYNK_TOKEN`, create a new project in the Blynk IoT app or web dashboard. The token will be provided in the device info.
    * In your Blynk template, add a **Gauge widget** and assign it to Virtual Pin `V0`. Configure its reading range (e.g., 0 to 1023) to match the sensor's ADC output.

### üöÄ Usage

1.  **Power On**: Connect your ESP32 to a power source using the Micro-USB cable.
2.  **Monitor Serial Output**: Open the serial monitor in Thonny IDE. You will see messages indicating Wi-Fi connection status and the raw MQ-4 gas values along with calculated voltage.
3.  **View on Blynk**: Open your Blynk IoT app or web dashboard. The Gauge widget assigned to `V0` will display the real-time gas sensor readings from your ESP32. Move the MQ-4 sensor near a gas source (e.g., a lighter - briefly and carefully!) to observe changes in the readings.
