This project demonstrates robust, bidirectional communication between two MicroPython-enabled ESP devices (ESP32/ESP8266) using ESP-NOW.

The **Sender device** acts as a control panel with physical buttons and an OLED screen to monitor status. The **Receiver device** manages a 4-channel relay module and continuously monitors environmental data using a DHT11/DHT22 sensor, sending the readings back to the Sender in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Sender Device (Control Panel) | Receiver Device (Actuator/Sensor Hub) |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Control** | 4 Push Buttons to toggle relays | 4-Channel Relay Module (Active-Low) |
| **Communication** | Sends R:S messages (e.g., 1:1, 4:0) | Receives relay commands and executes them |
| **Feedback** | Receives and displays Temperature/Humidity on a 0.96" I2C OLED | Reads DHT11/DHT22 sensor data every 2 seconds |
| **Network** | Adds Receiver as a peer and sends data | Saves the MAC of the last sender to reply with sensor data |

## ⚙️ Configuration and Setup

### 1. Get the Receiver's MAC Address
On the Receiver board, run the following in the MicroPython REPL:
```python
import network
sta = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta.active(True)
print(sta.config('mac'))  # prints MAC as bytes
```

### 2. Update sender.py
Replace the placeholder MAC address with the actual one:
```python
# ----------------------------
# Add Peer (Receiver MAC)
peer = b'\xd8\xbf\xc0\x0ed\xe9'  # replace with receiver MAC
esp.add_peer(peer)
```

### 3. Upload and Run
1. Upload `receiver.py` to the Receiver board and run it.  
2. Upload `sender.py` to the Sender board and run it.

## 🚀 Usage

- **Control:** Press any button on the Sender to toggle the corresponding relay.  
- **Monitoring:** Receiver reads DHT sensor every 2 seconds and sends data back.  
- **Display:** Sender OLED updates with latest temperature and humidity readings.  

### Message Protocol

- **Sender → Receiver (Relay Control):** `[RelayNumber]:[State]` (e.g., `1:1` → Relay 1 ON)  
- **Receiver → Sender (Sensor Data):** `T:[Temperature],H:[Humidity]` (e.g., `T:25,H:60`)
