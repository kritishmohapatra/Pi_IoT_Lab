## üìñ Description
This project demonstrates **wireless communication between two ESP8266 boards using ESP-NOW**.  
- **Sender ESP8266**: Reads a push button and sends toggle commands.  
- **Receiver ESP8266**: Turns an LED **ON/OFF** based on the received command.  

This setup is fast, low-power, and does **not require Wi-Fi or an access point**.

---

## ‚ö° Requirements
- 2 √ó ESP8266 boards (NodeMCU(ESP8266))  
- MicroPython firmware (v1.25 or newer)  
- USB cable for programming  
- Push button (for sender)  
- 2 √ó 10kŒ© resistors (if external pull-up/pull-down required)  
- LED + 220Œ© resistor (for receiver)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. **Flash MicroPython** to both ESP8266 boards (use `esptool.py` or NodeMCU flasher).  
2. Use **Thonny / uPyCraft / ampy** to upload:  
   - `sender.py` ‚Üí Sender ESP8266  
   - `receiver.py` ‚Üí Receiver ESP8266  
3. Rename files to `main.py` so they run automatically on boot.  
4. Reset both ESP boards ‚Üí Press button on sender ‚Üí LED toggles on receiver. ‚úÖ

## üì° Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Receiver's MAC Address
Run this code on the **Receiver ESP8266** to find its MAC address:

```python
import network
sta = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta.active(True)
print(sta.config('mac'))

 ```
